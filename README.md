## Implementation Process (using cursor)

### Part 1: Initial Generation
I used Cursor AI to generate the initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the User Profile Card component.

**Initial Prompt:**
```
Create a responsive User Profile Card component with HTML, CSS, and basic structure. The card should include:

- A placeholder for a user avatar (circular image).
- User's full name.
- Username (e.g., @username).
- A short bio section.
- A "Follow" button.

Requirements:
- Use HTML5 semantic structure
- Include inline CSS for styling
- Make it visually appealing with clean, modern design
- Ensure responsive design that works on all screensize
- Use a card-like appearance with subtle shadows/borders
- For bio line clamp to max 3 lines
- Style the avatar as circle (put identicon there for default)
- Make the Follow button clickable-looking
- Use placeholder content for demo

Please provide complete HTML with inline CSS in a single file.
```

**Result:**

### Part 2: Modifications & Refinements

**Modification Prompt:**
```
Now enhance the previously created responsive User Profile Card component with the following updates:

Interactivity: Make the "Follow" button toggle its text between "Follow" and "Following" when clicked using JavaScript.

New Element: Add a section to display a "Location" (e.g., "San Francisco, CA").

Styling Change: Change the background color of the card on mouse hover to give visual feedback.

Requirements:

- Continue using HTML5 semantic structure
- Use inline CSS and minimal JavaScript (in the same HTML file)
- Maintain clean, modern design and responsive layout
- Keep the card appearance consistent with subtle shadows and borders
```

**Results:**

### Conditional Logic Implementation

For the conditional logic to show "Own Profile" instead of "Follow" when viewing one's own profile, I would implement it as follows:

```javascript
// Assume we have a variable that indicates if this is the user's own profile
const isOwnProfile = false; // This would be set dynamically based on user authentication

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    const followBtn = document.getElementById('followBtn');
    
    // Check if this is the user's own profile
    if (isOwnProfile) {
        followBtn.textContent = 'Own Profile';
        followBtn.disabled = true;
        followBtn.classList.add('disabled');
    } else {
        // Existing click handler for follow/unfollow functionality
        followBtn.addEventListener('click', function() {
            if (followBtn.textContent === 'Follow') {
                followBtn.textContent = 'Following';
                followBtn.classList.add('following');
            } else {
                followBtn.textContent = 'Follow';
                followBtn.classList.remove('following');
            }
        });
    }
});
```

**Own Profile View:**

## Manual Refinements

- No manual edits were made.

## Final Result

The final implementation includes:
- A visually appealing user profile card with modern styling
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Interactive Follow button that toggles state
- Location display with an icon
- Hover effects for better user experience
- Clean, semantic HTML structure
